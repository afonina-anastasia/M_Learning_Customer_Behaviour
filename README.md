# Customer Behavior Analysis

## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing the behavior of a company's customers. The primary objective is to create a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a customer making a purchase based on their data. The dataset includes information on 400 customers, encompassing unique identifiers, gender, age, and estimated salary. The model aims to predict the purchase decision (yes/no) based on these data inputs.

## Data Sources

The dataset includes information on 400 customers:
- Unique Identifier
- Gender
- Age
- Estimated Salary
- Purchase Decision (target variable)

## Libraries Used

- Pandas for data processing
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Scikit-Learn for logistic regression model building

## Analytical Steps

1. Data evaluation and cleaning.
2. Correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables.
3. Development and training of the logistic regression model.
4. Evaluation of the model's effectiveness.

## Results

Discussion of key findings and the model's effectiveness in predicting customer behavior.
